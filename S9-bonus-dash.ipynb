    "`.DataTable()` gets a `data` argument, a dictionnary, that’s why we use `.to_dict()` to convert the dataframe. `'records'` indicates how the method has to interpret the data in the dictionnary, in our example each column name will be a key, and the column values, the value (see [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_dict.html)).\n",

    "##### Note : Notebooks and Dash\n",
    "\n",
    "Personnally I don’t think that it is good idea to build the app cells after cells in a notebook, things can become quickly messy. It can have its pedagogical interest, allowing us to play around and see how some changes can affect the app, but if an app is already running, you can’t 're'-run it. So don’t launch a cell containing the `app.run()` code several times. To see the effects of your modifications you should rather go the url `http://127.0.0.1:8050` and refresh the page. For you personal use, as I think that notebooks don’t provide any beneficial advantages, I would instead advise you to write directly `.py` files with your favorite text editor. If you think that notebook brings you any advantage (if you don’t like to shift between your editor and brower, if you want to keep things in one place, or if you think that notebooks make the introduction of small changes and testing easier), consider to install the `jupyter_dash` package in your virtual environment. It will allow you to run Dash apps inside your notebook.\n",

    "You will be able to run the server in 3 different modes :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `mode=external` : the app will be launched in a seperate browser tab or window, as usual\n",
    "2. `mode=inline` : the app will be launched in the output area of the window\n",
    "3. `mode=jupyterlab` : the app will be launched in another JupyterLab tab\n",
    "\n",
    "Just run the app with the mode you chose :\n",

    "#### 4. Add controls (and callbacks)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Plotly figures are interactives : we can zoom in/out, get information, move along the plots, etc. using the mouse. With Dash, we can do more than that. For exemple we could use a slider to select the starting year from which we want to plot the distribution of the number of books published per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we need :\n",
    "\n",
    "* to create a slider to select the starting year\n",
    "* to define a function that will plot a histogram from the selected starting year\n",
    "* a way to send the year selected to the function each time the dropdown menu is used\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s it: the big problem we have to address is how to get our different components (figure, dropdown menu, etc.) to communicate with each other ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The response is *callback functions*. Callback is not a simple concept. It design a function stored like would be a variable, a data, and that can be passed to another function as argument. This second function can then call the callback function during execution (like a function would call a variable/data). \n",
    "\n",
    "For us it just means that we can use functions that can be launched (or called) almost continuously (or at least a lot of time by seconds) to listen to some signals or event, and trigger actions if and when a certain signal or event occurs. For exemple we can define a callback that listen to a slider, and when a value (a year) is selected, sends this value to another function we have defined, for example a function that would plot a chart in relation to this value (a histogram with data starting from the selected year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a `@callback` gets `Input()` from a component and pass them to a function that will provide outputs (data, figure, etc.) that will be sent as an `Output()` to another component. To identify the components from which and to which the information/data goes, we assign `id`s to those components.\n",
    "The function that provide outputs is defined just below the `@callback` block (note : keywords with a `@` prefixes are called decorators and precede the function that they \"decorate\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for the callback function will look like this :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@callback(\n",
    "    Output(component_id='component-that-will-receive-output', component_property='property-that-will-be-modified') # Output() ALWAYS precede Input()\n",
    "    Input(component_id='component-that-provide-input', component_property='property-that-represent-input')\n",

When the lines of a short and a long averages cross (when one passes above or below the other), this kind of event is ofen the sign of a change in the tendancy or the dynamic of the phenomenon we observe, because this is a sign that rapid change is conflicting with a long-term trend.

Concerning our data, let’s say that we focus on the closing price. Each point of a short SMA line will be calculated as the average of the closing price for the 50 days before (200 days before for long SMA).
